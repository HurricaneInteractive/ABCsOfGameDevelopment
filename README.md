# ABCs of Game Development

This is a self imposed challenge I have given myself. Create 26 games using the letters of the alphabet.

**IMPORTANT:** Because of this, I am build each one over a weekend of casual coding, none of the code is going to be clean or the best way of doing it. I really just want to have some experience with making games and actually complete them instead of moving onto something else.

I put each word in a random word generator and got the following. This list will go into the first commit of the repo so everyone can see I am sticking with the words I got. The only time it will change is when I update the word with a link to the itch.io page.
